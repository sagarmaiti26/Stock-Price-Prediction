INTRODUCTION:-
The primary aim of a stock price prediction project using machine learning is to construct a model capable of accurately forecasting future stock prices based on historical market data. This involves discerning patterns and relationships within the data to enhance predictive accuracy. The complexity of stock market prediction stems from factors such as market volatility and the myriad of variables influencing stock values. These variables make precise forecasting challenging for even seasoned experts. Successful predictions can result in substantial profits for sellers and brokers. While predictions are often considered chaotic, rather than random, machine learning provides an effective means to model and analyze these intricate processes by leveraging historical market data.

METHODOLOGY:-
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the
development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and
make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The working principle
of machine learning involves several key components:
1) Data collection
2) Data preprocessing
3) Model selection and training
4) Evaluation and validation
5) Prediction or decision-making
6) Iterative refinement 

FUTURE SCOPE:-
1) Enhanced Prediction Models:-- These models can capture complex patterns and
dependencies in data, leading to more accurate predictions.
2) Real-Time Predictions:-- Faster computing and streaming data will enable traders and
investors to make more informed decisions with real time predictions.
3) Automated Trading Systems:-- Automated trading systems that use stock price
prediction models are a potential future development.
4) Risk Assessment:-- Machine learning models can be used to assess risk factors, such as
volatility, market risk, and systemic risk.
